BaseAddressGen
--------------

This is a utility that I wrote a long time ago (2001 by the look of the file dates).

This solved a problem with VB6 where if you wrote multiple VB DLL's they all loaded into the same base address in memory.  Since 2 files can't occupy the same memory the second one would need to be moved and by the OS which all made it a little slower. 

This utility generates valid loading addresses for VB6 dlls

Maybe someone somewhere sometime might find it useful.

I doubt it though.
